# Session 117/118 — Debounce Search, Whiteboard Scroll, Form Validation (Complete)

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Model:** Opus 4.6
**Commits:** `9aaf4d2` (Session 117), + Session 118 commit

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Debounced Search Inputs (Code Review Item #5 — DONE)
- Created `hooks/useDebouncedValue.ts` — generic hook with 200ms default delay
- Applied to **SearchPanel** via `app/coach/page.tsx` → `useCoachData` receives `debouncedSearchQuery`
- Applied to **MovementLibraryPopup** — all 4 filter useMemos (exercises, lifts, benchmarks, forge benchmarks) use `debouncedSearch`
- Prevents lag on large datasets by debouncing keystroke filtering

### 2. Coach Whiteboard Scrollable Cards
- `components/coach/WhiteboardGallery.tsx` — Changed card images from cropped (`overflow-hidden` + `object-cover`) to scrollable (`overflow-y-auto` + `w-full h-auto`)
- Matches existing athlete whiteboard pattern

### 3. Form Validation (Code Review Item #4 — HIGH PRIORITY COMPLETE)
**All 7 HIGH priority files done:**
- `components/athlete/logbook/ScoringFieldInputs.tsx` — time: maxLength+pattern, rounds/reps/weight/calories/distance: min+max constraints
- `components/athlete/MovementResultInput.tsx` — same validation pattern applied
- `components/coach/athletes/AddLiftModal.tsx` — weight: min=0 max=999 step=0.5 required, notes: maxLength=500
- `components/coach/ExerciseFormModal.tsx` — name: required maxLength=100, display_name: maxLength=100, description: maxLength=1000, video_url: type=url maxLength=500, search_terms: maxLength=500
- `components/coach/ConfigureLiftModal.tsx` — sets: min=1 max=99, reps: min=1 max=999, athlete notes: maxLength=500
- `components/coach/WorkoutFormFields.tsx` — session type: required maxLength=100, workout_name: maxLength=100
- `components/coach/ConfigureBenchmarkModal.tsx` — athlete notes: maxLength=500

**Remaining (MEDIUM priority — not started):**
- Registration, signup, profile, coach notes, payments forms

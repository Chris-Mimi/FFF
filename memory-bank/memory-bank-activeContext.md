## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES

| Rule | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| **Mandate** | Read `memory-bank/workflow-protocols.md` BEFORE any work |
| **Agent Use** | Use Agent for 3+ step tasks, multi-file changes, bug investigations |
| **Efficiency** | Target: Keep sessions under 50% context usage |
| **Context Monitoring** | 50%/60%/70%: Alert. 80%: STOP, finish current task, ask for Memory Bank update |

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal:** CrossFit gym management app with WOD creation, analysis, member booking system, and athlete performance tracking.

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) with RLS enabled
- Supabase Auth (signup/login/logout)
- Recharts for progress visualization
- Metric units enforced (kg, cm, meters)

## 📍 Current Status (Last 2 Weeks)

**Completed (2025-11-07):**
- **UI Refinements:** Coach and Athlete page improvements
  - Coach pages: Changed background to gray-400 for consistency with athlete pages
  - Coach Benchmarks & Lifts: Compact 5-column grid, teal cards, count badges, darker text
  - Drag-and-drop reordering for Forge Benchmarks with grip handle (fixes button conflicts)
  - Athlete benchmarks: Cards collapse to show only name, expand on hover, results always visible
  - See `project-history/2025-11-07-ui-refinements.md` for details

**Completed (2025-11-06 Session 2):**
- **Athlete UI Redesign & UX Improvements:** Comprehensive redesign with 8 commits
  - Cyan theme: Darker background (gray-400), cyan cards across all tabs
  - Barbell Lifts: Removed categories, 5-column grid, olympic lifts on dedicated bottom row
  - Benchmarks: Intelligent sorting (completed first, then by recency)
  - Personal Records: Forge Benchmarks section, collapsible accordions, 4-column layout
  - Charts: Red "PR!" badges on best results per scaling level
  - Fixed lift display to show actual rep max type (not estimated 1RM only)

**Completed (2025-11-06 Session 1):**
- **Athlete Page Enhancements:** Benchmark cards and PR display
  - Added Forge Benchmarks tab (fetches from `forge_benchmarks` table)
  - Compact card design: 5 columns on large screens, hover shows details
  - Fixed PR logic: Prioritizes scaling hierarchy (Rx > Sc1 > Sc2 > Sc3) then best time
  - Multi-PR display: Shows best result per scaling level (e.g., Rx 20:41, Sc1 7:55)

**Completed (2025-11-05):**
- **Database-Driven Benchmarks & Lifts:** Coach management UI for benchmarks and lifts
  - Replaced hardcoded arrays with database tables
  - Coach CRUD interface at `/coach/benchmarks-lifts` with 3 tabs
  - Athletes now see dynamic lists based on coach configuration
  - Tables: `benchmark_workouts`, `forge_benchmarks`, `barbell_lifts`

**Active Development:**
- None

**Known Issues:**
- macOS iCloud Keychain autofill popups (OS behavior, not app bug)

**Lessons Learned (2025-11-06):**
- **Cline/Grok requires Active Context:** Even for "simple" UI tasks, Cline needs to read `memory-bank-activeContext.md` first to prevent analysis paralysis. Without context, Cline overthinks and gets stuck (observed: 10+ min on 2-min task). Active Context acts as confidence anchor.

## 📋 Next Immediate Steps

1. Test late cancel/no-show functionality in production
2. Remove PUBLIC RLS policies before production
3. Consider adding coach ability to edit section types, workout types, exercises
